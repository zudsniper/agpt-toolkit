## ABSTRACT  
While this repository originally started as a single tool for helping me manage my instances of the absolutely revolutionary [`Auto-GPT`](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), an LLM tool which utilizes the `OpenAI` `GPT-3.5` & `GPT-4` models via the API endpoints to create a potentially _fully autonomous goal completion engine_.    

Now I plan to use the repository like a monorepo for all my script tools related to [`Auto-GPT`](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), or [`Auto-GPT-Plugins`](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins), which are where things start getting really scary. We need a plugin package manager already 

Let me not mince my words here. 
### **This thing is essentially capable of _reason._**   

## PROJECTS  
```
> ⏯ init_agpt (init)
---------------------------   
    small bash script configured to make starting a
    barelones Auto-GPT docker container easier for me.
    YMMV. 

> 📦 agpt-pkg-gen (pkg-gen)
---------------------------
    bash script that aims to provide a full-stack
    build system for AutoGPT, similar to AWS Amplify 
    or similar tools. 
```
## IDEAS
```
> 🎁 agpt-pkg (pkg)
---------------------------  
    a package manager for Auto-GPT plugins. 
    wouldn't want to be responsible for a bad actor, so
    I suppose the valid plugins should only be those which
    are featured on the AGPT plugins page. 
    
    Other plugins should be allowed but must be installed
    via a repository link or local path

```

## `Auto-GPT` PLUGIN IDEAS
```
> 📞 Phone Calls + SMS / 📱 Phone Services API (Topic)
---------------------------
    Not sure as to the ideal way to accomplish this, but perhaps via prepaid plans for phones which are then used as a dummy devices. Alternative is just using an API like Twilio -- but that is expensive. I think potentially both should be options.  
    
> 🎤 Audio VoiceChat (Topic)
---------------------------
    Skype, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Discord (Self-bot)
    I believe these plugins would all break their
    respective company's Terms of Service, so I do not
    condone making them. 

> 📷 Snapchat
---------------------------
    This follows the vein that the current plugins are
    running through, but with the added complexity of the
    photos. Generating them at this stage seems
    unrealistic due to human recognition, but it may not
    seem as infeasible in the future.  
```

## "What The Fuck?"  
I don't know. This probably won't work -- but if it ever does, even for a moment, that would be **SO GOOD** for my procrastination.  

> _"Aren't you worried about the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence?"_   
  
Yes.  

> _"Then why are yo-"_   
  
No further questions.
